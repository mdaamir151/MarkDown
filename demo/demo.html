:h1 Instruction
:p Use '::p ', ::p\n' or '::p{:i[gray]{...text...}}' for paragraph, where \n is newline. Formatting has to be passed inside []. This is true for any element
:p[red] For e.g., '::p[red]' displays text in red.

:p[blue italic center] Center aligned italic blue paragraph!

:p Supported elements are 
:h1 h1 or header1
:h2 h2 or header2
:h3 h3 or header3
:h ::h is same as ::h1
'f' for :f[2s blue] formatting, b :b bold, i :i italics, d :d delete, u :u underline
:h[red] :k is unsupported element
:q :b Note: This is a quote

:p while line is as follows:
:l

:tb[striped]{
:th A|B|C|D
:tr 1|2|3|4
:tr td1|td2|td3|td4
:tr td1|td2-pipe:||td3|td4
}

:p By default, paragraph and header end at new line. Most others end with space and some like line end immediately. 
:b{To change endpoints or delimiters, use curly brackets({})}. Don't use {} for block elements like h and p if they're already line delimited. Otherwise unnecessay line breaks may be inserted

:p[green italic] [Work going on!]

:p Use browserify to create bundle with your own changes:
:q browserify demo.js > bundle.js
